This project demonstrates how to use a SentenceTransformer model to generate embeddings for the reviews text in the Yelp review dataset. The SentenceTransformer model is run in parallel on multiple GPUs and the generated embeddings are added to an 'embeddings' column in the dataframe. After the forward pass, the dataframes augmented with the generated embeddings generated by each GPU are concatenated. After a certain number of reviews have been processed, the dataframe is written to a parque file which is then uploaded to S3.
